<h2 align=left>Construction of an DFA equivalent to given regular expression</h2>

<div class="meanings">

<h3>What is DFA?</h3>
<p>DFA stands for Deterministic Finite Automaton. Its job is to read in a string of symbols (input) and move (transition) between its states based on the input and ultimately accept or reject the string of symbols</p>

<h3>What is Regex and what they do?</h3>
<p>Regular expressions are a way of expressing regular languages. In fact, the basic operation of a regex engine is to convert a regex pattern to either an NFA or DFA internally. Then, faced with a string, the N/DFA reads the symbols one by one and transitions between its states and finally spits out if the string of symbols matches the pattern/language or not.</p>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>Insert the expression:</p>
<input type = "text" name = "Regex" value = "" maxlength = "100"/>
